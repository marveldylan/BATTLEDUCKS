 ## ***DESCRIPTION***
 ### BATTLEDUCKS is a high-octane, turn-based, duck-themed card game for two players! Elements of BATTLEDUCKS are inspired by popular virtual and real-life card games, such as [GWENT: The Witcher Card Game](https://www.playgwent.com/en), [Epic Spell Wars](https://cryptozoic.com/collections/epic-spell-wars), and [Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack). Everyone knows that ducks are competitive creatures by nature, and we've gathered the coolest, best ducks around to compete in the fiery crucible that is BATTLEDUCKS!!!
 &nbsp;
## ***HOW TO PLAY***
### OVERVIEW: Players compete by playing DUCK cards, with the goal of attacking the other opponent. Each turn, a player can either lay a card or draw a card. Each DUCK card has an attack and defense stat. Laying a DUCK card in the attack row plays its attack stat, nullifying the defense stat. Similarly, laying a DUCK card in the defense row adds to player defense and does not contribute to attack. After 20 turns, attack and defense for each player is compared. Player 1 attack goes against Player 2 defense, and vice versa. Whichever player has the highest point differential (attack vs defense) wins!

 ### THE BOARD: The game board is split into 20 tiles, 10 for each player. On their turn, a player is able to lay a DUCK card on one of their tiles. The game board features an attack row and defense row. Attack row plays a card's attack, and defense plays a card's defense.
 &nbsp;
  ### THE DUCKS: What we're all here for. BATTLEDUCKS is played with DUCK cards, each with a unique name, image, and stats - in the future, some DUCKS even have special features that activate events throughout the game! Choose the best combination of DUCKS to lay in a round to defeat your opponent.

## **Instructions for Developers**
* Fork and clone this repo

## **Known Issues**
* Draw feature will replace current card ids and won't update on game board.
* If player hand is empty, draw feature will fill hand and allow to continue turn.
* Draw function may not end turn as it should - player is still able to lay cards after a draw (random at the moment).
* Back of card does  not render. Implemented hide feature for the time being.
* Card images may spill outside of game board tiles.
